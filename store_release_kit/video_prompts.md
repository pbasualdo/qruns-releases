### Scene 2: The UI Tour (Simulated Dashboard)

### Scene 3: Feature Focus: Pro Code Syntax

## 2. Advanced Global Settings for Flow

* **Motion Scale**: 5 (Keep it professional and steady).
* **Camera Control**: Select *Zoom In* or *Horizontal Pan* for the Intro/Outro scenes to add depth.
* **Motion Brush**: If your tool supports it, paint the "logo" or "code lines" to give them a glowing pulse while keeping the background stable.
* **Negative Prompt**: "morphing, text distortion, blurry UI, generic stock footage, bright white backgrounds, extra limbs, flickering, watermark."

> [!TIP]
> If you are using **Flow Studio**, you can also use the **Image-to-Video** feature by uploading the carátulas (Intro/Outro) I generated and applying the motion prompts above to ensure the branding stays 100% consistent.
