# IT Quick Runbooks Privacy Statement

Last Updated: January 2026

Your privacy is important to us. This privacy statement explains the personal data IT Quick Runbooks processes, how IT Quick Runbooks processes it, and for what purposes.

## Personal Data We Collect

IT Quick Runbooks is a desktop application designed to operate primarily as "Local-First".

**We do not collect or store your personal data on our servers.**

However, the application may process the following data locally on your device:

- **Access Credentials**: Such as GitHub Personal Access Tokens (PAT), required to clone private repositories or publish releases. These are stored securely in your local environment (e.g., environment variables or user-protected local files).
- **Local File Paths**: The application accesses directories you explicitly select to read and manage your runbooks.

## How We Use Personal Data

IT Quick Runbooks uses data exclusively to provide the functionality required by the user:

- **Repository Management**: We use your Git credentials to authenticate clone, pull, or push operations directly with GitHub servers.
- **Application Updates**: The application may connect to public servers (such as GitHub Releases) to check for new versions. During this process, standard technical data (like your IP address) may be transmitted to the service provider (GitHub), subject to their own privacy policies.

## Reasons We Share Personal Data

**Qruns does not share your personal data with third parties.**

The application communicates directly with third-party services (like GitHub) only when you initiate an action that requires it (such as cloning a repo). In these cases, the interaction is direct between your device and the third party, without intermediation by IT Quick Runbooks servers.

## How to Access and Control Your Personal Data

Since data resides on your local device:

- **Access and Control**: You have full control over configuration files and runbooks stored on your hard drive.
- **Deletion**: You can delete the application and its configuration files (`.env`, data folders) at any time to erase any associated data.

## Cookies and Similar Technologies

IT Quick Runbooks is a desktop application and does not use "cookies" in the same way as a website. We do not use third-party trackers or behavioral analytics within the application.
